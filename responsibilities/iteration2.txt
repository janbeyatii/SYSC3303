Jan
* Extended the Swing GUI to display drone current state, active fire count, and current zone being serviced
* Updated GUI live based on scheduler and drone events (SchedulerListener)
* Ensured GUI reflects state transitions clearly (incident status, drone state, zone, event log)

Iman
* Implement drone states idle, en route, extinguishing, returning
* Simulate travel time, agent drop time, and battery usage using Iteration 0 values
* Handle partial agent usage and continuing to another zone if possible
* Notify scheduler on arrival, completion, and return
*  Drone state machine diagram
*  Drone subsystem UML updates
*  Verified calculations for timing and agent usage

Samy
*  Implemented scheduling logic
*  Added FIFO queue management for fire incidents 
*  Implemented the handling of dispatch and completion
*  Updated scheduler UML Class Diagram
*  Updated scheduler UML State Machine
*  verified through testing

Mithushan
*  Updated Testing for Iteration 2: Expanded and updated test cases to ensure all new functionalities and state transitions introduced in Iteration 2 are thoroughly tested.
*  SchedulerTest: Verified fire state transitions (PENDING, ASSIGNED, COMPLETED). Tested scheduler state machine transitions (IDLE, HAS_PENDING, DRONE_BUSY).
*  DroneSubsystemTest: Tested drone state transitions (IDLE, EN_ROUTE, EXTINGUISHING, RETURNING). Simulated travel time, extinguishing, and return processes. Verified partial agent usage and handling of multiple incidents.
*  FireIncidentSubsystemTest: Tested CSV parsing for fire incidents, including severity levels and invalid lines. Verified incidents are sent to the scheduler and callbacks are invoked on completion.
*  IntegrationTest: Validated the integration of Scheduler, DroneSubsystem, and FireIncidentSubsystem. Ensured round-trip communication and timing correctness for multiple incidents.
*  State Machine Testing: Ensured all state transitions for Scheduler, DroneSubsystem, and FireIncidentSubsystem were exercised through unit and integration tests.
